# El_Gamal_Encryption_with_Compression

This code demonstrates El Gamal Encryption Algorithm step by step, but compression of the plaintext is applied before computing the El Gamal Encryption.

The plain text is encoded to numbers: a=00 b=01 c=02 d=03.... Then compression is applied to the encoded number set. Next, the El Gamal Encryption algorithm is applied to encrypt the message (compressed encoded number set).
